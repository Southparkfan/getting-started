## AllContributors
Repository administrators are allowed to install this application for Repositories. To install, follow the instructions from [https://allcontributors.org/](https://allcontributors.org/). When you enter the GitHub website, you arrive on a page similar to [this page](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/getting-started/blob/main/images/allcontributors.png). Choose "Only select repositories", and select the relevant repositories. **When there is a "request" tag next to the repository description, you are not the repository admin.
